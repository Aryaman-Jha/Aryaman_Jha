I'm an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. I'm also exploring the field of Cognitive Science and is registered in a minor program in that department. My interest lie in Signal Processing, Human Cognition and Computer Vision, with a dream of building an artificial agent which can mimic humans!! 

Apart from academic interests, I love to do pencil sketching, kirigami, wasting my time watching animes and (Spending time alone absolutely thinking nothing... )
