I'm a Physics undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. I'm currently exploring the world of Molecular machines at the intersection of Biology and Physics to gain an understanding of the principles Biology uses to create its Programmable matter. My interest lie in Molecular Biology,  Statistical Physics, Dynamical Systems with a dream to create smart functional matter with an abundance of applications!

Personally, I enjoy sketching, singing, puzzle solving(Yes I am a Nerd), and lots and lots of talking.
